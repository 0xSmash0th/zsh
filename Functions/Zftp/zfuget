# function zfuget {
# Get a list of files from the server with update.
# In other words, only retrieve files which are newer than local
# ones.  This depends on the clocks being adjusted correctly
# (i.e. if one is fifteen minutes out, for the next fifteen minutes
# updates may not be correctly calculated).  However, difficult
# cases --- where the files are the same size, but the remote is newer,
# or have different sizes, but the local is newer -- are prompted for.
#
# Files are globbed on the remote host --- assuming, of course, they
# haven't already been globbed local, so use 'noglob' e.g. as
# `alias zfuget="noglob zfuget"'.
#
# Options:
#  -G    Glob:     turn off globbing
#  -v    verbose:  print more about the files listed.
#  -s    silent:   don't ask, just guess.  The guesses are:
#                - if the files have different sizes but remote is older ) grab
#                - if they have the same size but remote is newer        )
#                  which is safe if the remote files are always the right ones.
#   -t   time:     update the local file times to the same time as the remote.
#                  Currently this only works if you have the `perl' command,
#                  and that perl is version 5 with the standard library.
#                  See the function zfrtime for more gory details.
