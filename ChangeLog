	* 14736: Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo: make docs for _wanted and
	_requested clearer (command has to allow options passed to it)

	* 14733: Completion/Base/Utility/_arguments: two fixes: try all
	actions that have to be tried (but only once), execute actions
	if we aren't after an option already (in the same word)
