	* unposted: Completion/Unix/Command/_aap: short and long options
	are mutually exclusive

2004-04-23  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 19825: Completion/Unix/Command/_perforce: suggested by Michael
	Denio: add `changes' style to allow limitting list of changes
	offered for completion.

	* 19810: Src/exec.c: avoid setting flag on Eprog which may
	no longer be valid.  Had no feedback, so don't know if
	it helps, but at worst harmless.

	* 19812: Src/builtin.c: avoid race with autoloaded trap functions.
	However, I think these still need substantial improvement.

2004-04-21  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 19809: Src/jobs.c, Src/signals.c, Src/signals.h: improve
	zsh-users/7365 by only queuing traps when TRAPS_ASYNC is set.
	This avoids any nasty races, including one reported by Vincent
	Stemen.

2004-04-21  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>

	* 19806: Src/prompt.c: fix bug with %v expansion and negative index

	implemented.

	Completion/compinstall, Completion/bashcompinit,
	Completion/Base/Widget/_next_tags, Completion/Zsh/Type/_functions,
	Completion/Zsh/Command/_typeset, Doc/Zsh/builtins.yo:
	store flags for -z and -k options to autoload allowing the
	completion system to be used with ksh_autoload set

	* 19800: Test/B02typeset.ztst: reverse sense of `declare +m' test

2004-04-19  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 19798: Completion/Unix/Command/.distfiles,
	Completion/Unix/Command/_bogofilter: rudimentary completion for

	for a child process.

2004-04-18  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	return value parameter

2004-04-15  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* see 19778 etc.: Doc/Makefile.in: remove change from 19735.

2004-04-15  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 19606: Completion/Unix/Command/_tla: switch tla completion to
	the version by Jason McCarty, Erik Toubro Nielsen, and Rob Weir.

2004-04-14  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* Jay Berkenbilt: 19769: Completion/Unix/Command/_rsync:
	fix quoting for remote file completion, add -L to ls command.

2004-04-14  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>

	complete files/urls for svn cp and mv commands

	* 19743: Test/D02glob.ztst: Test the new F glob qualifier.

	a dir contains a subdir.

2004-04-06  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>

	* 19712, 19740: Src/params.c, Doc/Zsh/params.c: allow assigning to
	associative array elements where the i or r subscript flag is used

2004-04-06  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* Peter Castro <doctor@fruitbat.org>: 19735 (minus texinfo hunk):
	Doc/Makefile.in, Src/builtin.c, Src/exec.c, Src/main.c,
	Src/system.h, configure.ac: improved use of paths, text/binary
	and dynamic library usage for Cygwin.

	* 19733 (with improved documentation): Doc/Zsh/contrib.yo,
	Doc/Zsh/zle.yo, Functions/Misc/zed, Src/Zle/zle_keymap.c,
	Src/Zle/zle_main.c: vared -M and -m allow you to provide
	main and alternate keymap; zed will use keymaps zed and zed-vicmd.

2004-04-05  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* unposted, suggested by Wayne: Doc/Zsh/expn.yo:
	make 19728 clearer.

	* 19728: Doc/Zsh/expn.yo: explain that (^F) (from 19717)

	* unposted: ChangeLog, ChangeLog-4.1: move stuff up to 4.2.0
	out of ChangeLog.

	* unposted: Config/version.mk: update version to 4.2.0-dev-1;

	* 19717: Doc/Zsh/expn.y, Src/glob.c: use F glob qualifier

2004-03-31  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* unposted: Functions/Misc/zrecompile: change "mv" to "mv -f"
	when backing up .zwc files, because zcompile creates the files
	read-only.  See thread ending at users/7269.

2004-03-30  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>

	* 19708: Completion/compaudit: change getent() function to
	handle two arguments

	* 19707: Src/params.c, Test/D05array.ztst: fix bug where a
	nagative index into an array returned a one element array
	instead of a scalar

2004-03-25  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 19691: Completion/Unix/Type/_diff_options: Allow more than
	one --exclude or -x to diff.

2004-03-25  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	configure.ac, Doc/Zsh/mod_zftp.yo, Src/Modules/zftp.c,
	Etc/NEWS, Functions/Zftp/zfstat: Add support for non-standard
	ports to core zftp.  Not yet handled by the function system
	(except zfstat reports port): needed in lastloc	and bookmarks.

2004-03-23  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 19661: Danek Duvall: Completion/Unix/Type/_diff_options:
	support diff -u on Solaris from 2.10 up.

2004-03-22  Peter Stephenson  <pws@pwstephenson.fsnet.co.uk>

	* 19669, 19670: Danek Duvall: Completion/compaudit: Use of
	getent to check groups was slow; typo caused duplicate fpath
	entries.

	* 19671: Src/Zle/zle_main.c: error in zle-line-init caused
	infinite loop.

2004-03-20  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>
