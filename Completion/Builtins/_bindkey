#compdef bindkey

# Normally, this completes names of zle widgets, whether the builtin ones
# or ones defined by the user.  Note that a - allows a wildcard before it,
# so h-b-s-b will complete to history-beginning-search-backward.  You
# can alter this by removing the -M ... from the second compgen.
#
# Where appropriate, will complete keymaps instead of widgets.
