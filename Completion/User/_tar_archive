#autoload

# This is used to generate filenames usable as a tar archive. This may
# get one argument, a collection of tar option characters that may be
# used to find out what kind of filename is needed. If no argument is
# given but the parameter `_tar_cmd' is set, that is used.
# If your version of `tar' supports this you may want to complete
# things like `host:file' or `user@host:file' here.
