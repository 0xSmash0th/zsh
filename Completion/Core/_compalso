# This searches $* in the array for normal completions and calls the result.
# It is used to include completions for another command or special context
# into the list generated by the calling function.
# For example the function for `-subscript-' could call this as in
# `_compalso -math-' to get the completions that would be generated for a
# mathematical context.
