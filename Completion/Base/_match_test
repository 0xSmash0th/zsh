#autoload

# This function is called at the beginning of functions that do matching in
# shell code. It should test the value of the `MATCHER' special parameter
# and return non-zero if the calling function should try to generate matches
# for the global match specification in use.
#
# This function gets one argument, the name of the function calling it.
#
# If you have a global match specification with more than one set of patterns
# you may want to modify this function to return non-zero for all of your
# match specifications and modify the function `_match_pattern' to build the
# pattern to use in the calling function.

(( MATCHER == 1 ))
