#compdef -default-

# We first try the `compctl's. This is without first (-T) and default (-D)
# completion. If you want them add `-T' and/or `-D' to this command.
# If there is a `compctl' for the command we are working on, we return
# immediatly. If you want to use new style completion anyway, remove the
# `|| return'. Also, you may want to use new style completion if the 
# `compctl' didn't produce any matches. In that case remove the `|| return'
# and insert the line `[[ compstate[nmatches] -eq 0 ]] || return' after
# `compcall'.
