This version of zsh is based on 3.1.5 and includes the following
patches.  (The version number built into the shell has not been changed.)

  Old stuff:

Zoli's AIX dynamic loading patch from 3933, slightly updated, without
some hunks which weren't needed on AIX 3.x so I don't know how to
update properly.

My completion widgets patch

  Patches which have appeared since 3.1.5 (it's already a week, after
  all...):

Bart's addon collection 4473 (excluding the bit from 4105), 4475, 4476

My patch in 4477 to rename three functions to avoid clashes when
dynamic loading (particularly necessary on IRIX and AIX), including
the effect of Sven's additional fix in 4488

My patch 4513 for case-insensitive globbing via flags, plus fixlet 4552

Sven's magna opera patch-or 4510 and patch-match 4509 to add control of
alternative matches and arbitrary mapping between characters in the
command line and the matched, plus all known fixes 4526, 4527, 4534,
4555, 4557

My ~PWD patch 4533

My suggestion for fixing the suffix on a yank in 4564

Bart's deltochar patch including new flags to allow commands not to
interrupt cumulative effects in 4570

Bart's doc fiz 4574

Sven's latest word on the fixsuffix() horror in 4576, plus a
fixsuffix() added by hand in delcharorlist() which I've somehow missed
along the way

My latest version of lete2ctl, not posted
