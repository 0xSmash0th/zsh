This version of zsh is based on 3.1.5 and includes the following
patches.

  Old stuff:

Zoli's AIX dynamic loading patch from 3933, slightly updated, without
some hunks which weren't needed on AIX 3.x so I don't know how to
update them properly

My completion widgets patch

  Patches which have appeared since 3.1.5 (it's already a week, after
  all...):

Bart's addon collection 4473 (excluding the bit from 4105), 4475, 4476

My patch in 4477 to rename three functions to avoid clashes when
dynamic loading (particularly necessary on IRIX and AIX), including
the effect of Sven's additional fix in 4488

Sven's magna opera patch-or 4510 and patch-match 4509 to add control
of alternative matches and arbitrary mapping between characters in the
command line and the matched string, plus all known related fixes
4526, 4527, 4534, 4555, 4557

My patch 4513 for case-insensitive globbing via flags, plus fixlet 4552

My ~PWD patch 4533

My suggestion for fixing the suffix on a yank in 4564

Bart's deltochar patch including new flags to allow commands not to
interrupt cumulative effects in 4570 (new flag merged with compctl
widgets flags).

Bart's doc fix 4574

A fixsuffix() added by hand in delcharorlist() which I've somehow
missed along the way. The fixsuffix() horror is probably not yet
resolved; 4576 has side effects and hasn't been applied.

My latest version of lete2ctl, not posted but available at
http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/lete2ctl .

Bart's chpwd() fix 4589

  Second edition

Added line in zle_tricky.c missed when patching by hand, spotted by
Bart.  (Whitespace is still non-canonical in the completion code where
I have merged patches by hand.)

Fixed up my compctl widgets patch for use with Sven's rewrite, which I
hadn't done properly before.

Bart's function fixes, 4471

Bart's doc fixes, 4472

Bart's PWD and OLDPWD reshuffle, 4589

My test-line-length patch for prompts, 4591 (`%(40l.yes.no)' outputs
`yes' if at least 40 characters have already appeared on the line,
`no' otherwise.)

Configure patch from Wilfredo Sanchez in 4594, with some extra
tabbification and without the setterm() hunk, since I've already renamed
that to zsetterm(), avoiding the conflict

My globbing fix for a bug which shows up in `case' constructs, 4595

Alternative version of the ~PWD patch (allow users to hash PWD
explicitly if that's what turns them on), 4596

Bart's experimental associative array patch, 4598, plus various
additions, 4599, 4602, 4608, 4641, 4653, 4654.  No documentation yet;
if you want to play with this, so far:
% typeset -A hash                    # create associative array $hash
% hash[one]=eins hash[two]=zwei      # assign elements
% hash=(one eins two zwei)           # same, assign whole array (*)
% print $hash[one]                   # retrieve elements
eins
% print $hash                        # whole array looks like normal array
eins zwei
% print ${(k)hash}                   # flag to get keys
one two
% print ${(kv)hash}                  # flag to get keys and values (**)
one eins two zwei
Comparison of (*) and (**) will reveal how to copy an associative
array, `hash2=(${(kv}hash})', but you always need to `typeset -A
hash2' first or an ordinary array will appear.  There is a predefined
special associative array $testhash, for testing purposes only, which
will eventually disappear.

My rewrite of prompt truncation, 4601 --- note this introduces a
slight incompatibility in that the string to be truncated now runs by
default to the end of the string, instead of only covering individual
%-substitutions.  If necessary, stick in an extra '%>>' to turn
truncation off at the point you want.

Bart's params error message fix, 4606

My input fix for 8 bit characters, 4612

Bart's version of the *** fix, 4624

Bart's parameter substitution flag delimiter fix, 4644

My special parameter unset fix, 4662

  Third edition

I've taken the plunge and changed $ZSH_VERSION, the current one is now
3.1.5.pws-3 .  It seemed rational to have something incremental at the
end for testing, so I abandoned using the date.

4482 (cdmatch2)and 4641 (${assoc[0]}) now applied; 4641 was supposed
to be there before.

nroff manual pages deleted, you now need yodl.

deleted modules-bltin by hand, which `make distclean' somehow missed.
Caused problems when building a statically linked shell.

Bart's scanmatchtable fix, 4674

Commented out vifirstnonblank() in vioperswapcase(), pending any
better patch for it.

Bart's viforwardword fix, 4678

My case-independent globbing fix, 4693

Sven's zle_tricky.c, 4697

Sven's patch to ignore completions if the cursor is not in a part to
be completed, 4698, plus addition, 4707

I have not added Sven's zerr() patch, 4699, in case it has side
effects, but I haven't heard anything on the subject and I haven't
looked at it.

Sven's pennockite heap memory patch, 4700

Sven's condition module patch, 4716, and addition, 4732, and the
function wrapper patch, 4734, and additions, 4742, 4769: the module.c
bits of these have been moved around a little to avoid clashes with
the AIXDYNAMIC stuff.  The wrapper stuff is still not finished, but
doesn't currently impinge on use of the shell.

Phil Pennock's patch to use associative arrays in stat, 4727

Unposted fix for use of printcompctlptr in completion widgets:
printcompctl() had acquired another argument.

My bash-like ${foo/orig/new} patch, 4736, and the version to do
shortest matching together with optimizations of all pattern matching
in variable strings, 4754.

Phil's patch for typeset -a docs, 4737

Nobody wanted my fix for `FOO=x eval external', so it's not there.

zftp, 4761

Bart's fix for conddef without dynamical modules, 4762

Bart's associative array patches for implentation of subscripting flags,
4763, plus fix 4766; typeset output 4764

Sven's completion listing fix, 4767

  Fourth edition

Compilation fix for static linking, 4779

Phil's patch for wtmp in /var/log on Linux, which someone else sent
before... except it needs to be applied to aczsh.m4 and propagated
from there, 4783

Phil's removal of now useless j in glob.c, 4784

Bart's collection in 4788:  put back some missing patches.

Param's patches from Bart in 4789, 4794, 4795: fix sethparam() and move
flags; make sure setsparam() and sethparam() are consistent with
existing parameters; allow assoc array assignment with
${(AA)=assoc::=key1 value1 key2 value2}

Return to not hashing PWD from Bart in 4791

Handle --program-suffix and --program-prefix (but not --target, so I
removed the comment) from Bart in 4792

Compilation with no HAVE_GETPWUID, 4801

INADDR_NONE in zftp, 4805

Sven's unloading modules, 4806, 4815, 4820, plus my AIX (and
DYNAMIC_NAME_CLASH_OK) fix, 4822, then Sven's 4830

Parameter's documentation changes by Bart, 4817

Network order fix for zftp from Sven, 4821

My patch (with Gene Cohler's suggestions) for dynamical loading under
HPUX 10, 4824, plus fixes, 4833, 4843

Bart's random assoc array fixes, 4826, 4836, plus Sven's 4831

Sven's ignored character fix, 4828

More Sven condition patches, 4837, 4842

Final (???) isident() fix from Sven, 4845

  pws-5

Name of top level directory is now zsh-3.1.5-pws-5

Missing part of Bart's sethparam() changes, 4851

zftp test subcommand, 4852

Geoff's refresh fix for a line the same length as the terminal width,
4855

Bart's fix for array slices, 4874

Sven's accept-and-menu-complete-fix, 4878

Sven's group completion fix, 4879

Sven's module condition fixes, 4880

Oliver Kiddle's autoconf fix, 4887

My zftp fix (actually due to Andrej Borsenkow) for systems which only
allow dup'ing sockets after they are connected, 4888.

Bart's fix to making setting associative array elements inside
substitutions consistent, 4893

My typeset neatness and -a and -m fix, 4902

My brief Etc/MACHINES addition, 4912

My modification to findcmd() for memory leaks, 4923, plus comment
alteration by Bart, 4924

Sven's patch for completion after various reserved words, 4930

My patch for compiler warnings, 4931

My configuration fix for when tgetent() accepts a null argument but
then tgetstr() dumps core, 4939

Sven's alteration of `-t' behaviour, 4940.  This is slightly
incompatible with previous patched versions of 3.1.5 since now you don't
need '-tc' with -T.  However, you now do need '-tn' in cases where you
don't want normal completion tried after a -T matches.

Sven's new completion functions, 4850, 4881, 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944,
4946, 4949, 4950, plus my addition of function pointers, 4945.  The
example file is now in Misc/new-completion-examples.

(Effect of) fix from Helmut Jarausch in 4947 partly due to change
missed in patch.
