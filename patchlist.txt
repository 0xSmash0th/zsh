This version of zsh is based on 3.1.5 and includes the following
patches.  (The version number built into the shell has not been changed.)

  Old stuff:

Zoli's AIX dynamic loading patch from 3933, slightly updated, without
some hunks which weren't needed on AIX 3.x so I don't know how to
update them properly

My completion widgets patch

  Patches which have appeared since 3.1.5 (it's already a week, after
  all...):

Bart's addon collection 4473 (excluding the bit from 4105), 4475, 4476

My patch in 4477 to rename three functions to avoid clashes when
dynamic loading (particularly necessary on IRIX and AIX), including
the effect of Sven's additional fix in 4488

Sven's magna opera patch-or 4510 and patch-match 4509 to add control
of alternative matches and arbitrary mapping between characters in the
command line and the matched string, plus all known related fixes
4526, 4527, 4534, 4555, 4557

My patch 4513 for case-insensitive globbing via flags, plus fixlet 4552

My ~PWD patch 4533

My suggestion for fixing the suffix on a yank in 4564

Bart's deltochar patch including new flags to allow commands not to
interrupt cumulative effects in 4570 (new flag merged with compctl
widgets flags).

Bart's doc fix 4574

A fixsuffix() added by hand in delcharorlist() which I've somehow
missed along the way. The fixsuffix() horror is probably not yet
resolved; 4576 has side effects and hasn't been applied.

My latest version of lete2ctl, not posted but available at
http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/lete2ctl .

Bart's chpwd() fix 4589

  Second edition

Added line in zle_tricky.c missed when patching by hand, spotted by
Bart.  (Whitespace is still non-canonical.)

Fixed up my compctl widgets patch for use with Sven's rewrite, which I
hadn't done properly before.

Bart's function fixes, 4471

Bart's doc fixes, 4472

Bart's PWD and OLDPWD reshuffle, 4589

My test-line-length patch for prompts, 4591

Configure patch from Wilfredo Sanchez in 4594, with some extra
tabbification and without the setterm() hunk, since I've already renamed
that to zsetterm(), avoiding the conflict

My globbing fix for a bug which shows up in `case' constructs, 4595

Alternative version of the ~PWD patch (allow users to hash PWD
explicitly if that's what turns them on), 4596

Bart's experimental associative array patch, 4598, plus various
additions, 4599, 4602, 4608, 4641, 4653, 4654.  No documentation yet;
if you want to play with this, so far:
% typeset -A hash                    # create associative array $hash
% hash[one]=eins hash[two]=zwei      # assign elements
% hash=(one eins two zwei)           # same, assign whole array (*)
% print $hash[one]                   # retrieve elements
eins
% print $hash                        # whole array looks like normal array
eins zwei
% print ${(k)hash}                   # flag to get keys
one two
% print ${(kv)hash}                  # flag to get keys and values (**)
one eins two zwei
Comparison of (*) and (**) will reveal how to copy an associative
array, but you always need to declare it with typeset -A or an
ordinary array will appear.  There is a predefined special associative
array $testhash, for testing purposes only, which will eventually
disappear.

My rewrite of prompt truncation, 4601

Bart's params error message fix, 4606

My input fix for 8 bit characters, 4612

Bart's version of the *** fix, 4624

Bart's parameter substitution flag delimiter fix, 4644

My special parameter unset fix, 4662
